# WGAN And GAN

## 🚀 Overview
A deep learning project focused on implementing and training Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network(WGAN) and classic Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) to generate synthetic data. This project showcases expertise in machine learning, neural networks, and programming.
This projects contians 5 diffrent GANs:
  1. Celeb GAN: This is a classic GAN that generates fake celebs
  2. Eye WGAN: This is a WGAN that generates Medical images of Eyeball
  3. Fashion WGAN:  This is a WGAN that generates novel images of cholthing
  4. Peunoima WGAN: This is a WGAN that generates novel images of Penuomia x-ray scans
  5. Pokemon WGAN: This WGAN genrates new images based off pokemon

## 🛠️ Features
- Prepares dataset for use
- Creates a GAN or WGAN model
- Trains the model on the dataset
- Generates images based on datasets

## 🔧 Installation & Usage
1. Enter the file you wish to use and click "Open in Colab"
2. Download a dataset off of Kaggle and change the path to match your dataset path
3. Run the program and let it train on the dataset
4. The Images with display in th bottom of the Program
